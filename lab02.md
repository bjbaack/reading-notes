1) Choosing between more CPU cores or higher speed depends on what you're doing. More cores are great for multitasking and heavy tasks like video editing, while higher speeds boost single-task performance, perfect for gaming. The ideal number of cores varies: basic users might be fine with 4, while heavy users benefit from 6 or 8+

2) When selecting a motherboard, ensure it has the correct socket type for your CPU, supports the CPU's power requirements, offers enough RAM slots for your needs, and has the desired ports and expansion slots.

3) Key tradeoffs include capacity, speed, durability, and price. SSDs are faster and more durable than HDDs but are more expensive per gigabyte. HDDs offer more storage space for a lower price, making them a good choice for large data storage needs.

4) CPU is like the boss, making all the decisions. RAM is the computer's short-term memory, keeping what's needed at hand. Storage, like HDDs or SSDs, is where everything is kept for the long run. The motherboard is the hub where all parts connect and communicate. The power supply feeds electricity to every component. The case is the protective home for all these parts.
