1)  What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
  - First you have to prioritize the issues. and then work on them one at a timem. However you can also break them down into smaller task that might have somthing in common to fix them all at once.

2) What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
  - First you implement the solution and monitor it to make sure that it is truly resolved and to make sure there were no side effects. Then proceed to properly document the process you went through in case it comes up again and share it with anyone on the team. 

3)  What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
  - There are any benefits to documenting the entire process in a knowledge base. Being able to share the knowledge bing one of the most important, but also can be used as training. Also having it as a referece to look back on in case the issue comes back or you find it in another area. 

4) Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
  - Identify the problem would be the first step. After seeing what the issue is its time to come up with some ideas as to what the root cause of the issue is. Knowing that you might be in an office of people who might not be tech savvy. Knowing that you could also come up with theories as to updates or drivers. You then test out the theories  one by one to see if they fix any issue. Finally implement, document, and then see what preventive measures you cant take for next time.
