1) Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
  - shell is a program that lets you communicate with the computer  via commands. allowing you to talk to it in its "own language"
  - terminal is the window that you can type comma ds into and see the output of the commands. Allowing you to interact with the shell
  - cli allows you to control you computer by typing text commands into the termicnal.
  - command prompt specific to windos computers. similar to terminal.

They are still used today becuase of of speed and automation. insteead of searching your computer, you can type a command that just skips that process.

2) What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
  - change directories is 'cd'. list the files contents is 'ls' and remanme/move file is 'mv'
3) What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path.
  - Absolute path is the file address starting from the root directory, where a relative path is a file starting from the directory that you are in.
  - ~ or tilde is a shortcut for the users home directory ~documents instead of /home/user/documents.
  - / is an absolute path starting from the root directory of the file system.
