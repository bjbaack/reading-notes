1) You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
- My job is to investigate and understand malicious software, like viruses and ransomware, that try to harm computers and networks. I look at how they work, figure out how to stop them, and help protect our systems from future attacks
2) What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
  - Collection: Gather malware samples.
  - Static Analysis: Inspect the code without executing it.
  - Dynamic Analysis: Execute the code in a controlled environment.
  - Behavioral Analysis: Observe how the malware interacts with the system.
  - Code Analysis: Examine the code in detail to understand its functionality.
  - Documentation and Reporting: Record findings and create a detailed report.

3) You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?
  - Start with Static Analysis because it's safe and provides initial information without running the malware, minimizing the risk to the system.
