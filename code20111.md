3)  What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?
  - Sectors that can no longer be used due to wear or damage, leading to performance degradation and data loss. This slows down the data access and causes corruption.
4) How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?
  - Can help recover an SSD from non-physical issues like corruption or system crashes.
5) How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.
  - Techniques like power cycling can be essential for accessing important data on SSDs after power failures or minor physical impact. For quick data recovery can help businesses and individuals resume normal activities, aiding in community recovery efforts.
