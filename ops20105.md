3)  What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
  -  robocopy or robust file copy has advantages over xcopy such as resume file transfers if interrupted. Also for backing up files and working over WANS.

4) Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.
  - For me I think back to the Military when we would run networks. Having teh command line to check into the serever and see who was haveing issues or who was not running the proper applicaitions helped up keep a safe network. Grrabbing ip addresses was the main thing so we could trouble shoot each computer.
