1)  What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?
  - The Windows Registry is a database that stores settings and options for the operating system, including information about hardware, software, and user preferences.
2) What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?
  - The two types of registry settings for each Windows user account are user-specific settings (stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER) and system-wide settings (affecting all users, stored in parts like HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE).
3)  What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?
  - Registry hacks are modifications to the Windows Registry to change system settings, enabling customization and features not available through standard options, often used for personalization or troubleshooting.
4) What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?
  - Common tasks include modifying the appearance of the user interface, changing default program settings, disabling system features, and improving system performance.
5) Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?
  - Imagine the Windows Registry as the recipe book for a computer's operation, holding the instructions and ingredients (settings and preferences) for everything it does, similar to how a recipe book contains the steps and ingredients needed to make different dishes.
