The best jungle route for Trundle in League of Legends can vary based on the situation in the game, but two effective strategies are the five-camp clear with a Blue Buff start and the full clear with a Red Buff start.

For the five-camp clear starting with Blue Buff, you would follow this sequence:

Start at Blue Buff, using Chomp.
Proceed to clear Krugs and Murk Wolves to reach level three and unlock Pillar of Ice.
Take down the Red Brambleback for the Red Buff, which is important for ganking since Trundle lacks crowd-control.
After obtaining Red Buff, you're in a good position to gank the bottom or top lane depending on your side.
Then, secure the Scuttler and consider ganking the middle lane.
You may return to the jungle to clear Raptors and Krugs if ganking isn't a favorable option.
Alternatively, for a full clear starting with Red Buff:

Begin at Red Buff and use Chomp to kill it.
Then, move to Krugs and Raptors, and upon reaching level three, unlock Pillar of Ice.
Look for a quick gank opportunity in the middle lane.
Continue to clear the remaining jungle camps: Blue Buff, Gromp, and Murk Wolves.
This route is known to be effective for early pressure and potentially burning the enemy mid-laner's Flash early.
