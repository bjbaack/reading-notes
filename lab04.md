Ubuntu is a popular, free Linux OS based on Debian, great for desktops, servers, and clouds. It's user-friendly, secure, and comes with lots of software.
LTS (Long Term Support) versions are more stable and supported for five years, making them better for those who need reliability without frequent updates.
It's Ubuntu's default interface since 17.10, offering a modern and customizable desktop experience.
Use sudo apt update to update your package list, then sudo apt install package-name to install a new program, replacing package-name with the software's name.
