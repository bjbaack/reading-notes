1) What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
  - This is a shortcut for saying how big a chunk of internet addresses is. Instead of a bunch of numbers, you just see something like "/24" at the end of an IP address.
2) How many octets are found in an IPv4 address? Think of it as a neighborhood of internet addresses. It's a bunch of addresses that are grouped together and labeled with a common starting address and a size, like 192.168.1.0/24.
  - An IPv4 address is split into four parts, like a phone number with four sections. Each part is called an octet because it's made up of 8 bits.
4) What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
3) Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
  -  0-225
4) What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
  - It tells you how big the subnet is

1) In your own words, describe network segmentation.
  -  It's like putting up walls in a large room to create separate spaces, improving organization and security within a network
2) Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
  -  I don't agree. A good firewall is essential, but it's not enough. Network segmentation adds extra security layers, keeping potential breaches contained.
3) What is a screened subnet
  -  It's a safe area in a network, like a DMZ, that separates the outside world from the internal network, adding an extra layer of security.
4) Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
  - This refers to all the real-world barriers we use, like locks and alarms, to protect stuff from being stolen or tampered with
