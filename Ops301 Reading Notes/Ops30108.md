1) Explain each of the three Aâ€™s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story 
  - Authentication: Like showing your ID card to prove it's really you.
  - Authorization: Like checking your ticket to see which movie you can watch in the cinema.
  - Accounting: Like noting down all the snacks you buy at the movie to bill you later.
2) What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?
  - If the ACS server fails during AAA, the administrator should check the server status, confirm the user's details, and examine logs for errors. They may also switch to a backup system if one is available.
3) What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram. 
  - The NAS acts as the middleman, connecting users to the network and asking the ACS for permission to grant access and record what the user does.

# RADIUS Concepts

1) What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?
  - It centralizes user access management and supports a variety of authentication methods, making it easier and more secure to handle user access.  
2) What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?
  - RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service.
3) Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
  - RADIUS typically uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to encrypt passwords and can support additional encryption methods through other protocols like EAP.
