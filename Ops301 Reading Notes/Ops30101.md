1) What does “OSI” stand for?
  - OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
2) List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.
  - Layer 1: Physical Layer - Concerns with the physical connection between devices.
    Layer 2: Data Link Layer - Defines data formats on the network.
    Layer 3: Network Layer - Decides how to route packets from source to destination.
    Layer 4: Transport Layer - Provides reliable data transfer across a network.
    Layer 5: Session Layer - Manages sessions between applications.
    Layer 6: Presentation Layer - Ensures data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs.
    Layer 7: Application Layer - Interface for the end user operating applications.
3) Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?
  - Hardware Layers: Layers 1 and 2 (Physical and Data Link layers) are considered hardware layers           because they deal with physical components and how data frames are put onto the hardware for             transmission.
  - Software Layers: Layers 3 to 7 (Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application layers)       are software layers because they involve more abstract, software-based tasks like routing, data           transfer reliability, and application interfaces.
  - Meaning: Hardware layers are directly related to physical devices and media, while software layers       are more about the organization, processing, and management of data as it travels from one               application to another over the network.
4) How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?
  - The OSI model is great for troubleshooting because it helps you figure out where network issues are,     layer by layer. Start from the bottom with the physical connections and work your way up. If             something's wrong at the start, like no connection (a Layer 1 problem), it'll mess up everything         above it. Knowing where the issue stops lets you zoom in on the cause and fix it faster.

1) What is Wireshark?
  - Wireshark is like a digital detective tool that lets you see what's happening on a network, showing     all the data being sent and received.
2) What is a packet?
  - A packet is a little bundle of data sent over a network. It's like a letter in the postal system,        carrying information from one computer to another.
3) What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish?
  - Catching data in real-time: Wireshark can grab and display data as it's moving across the network,     letting you see live what's happening.
  - Inspecting details: It lets you dive deep into the data, checking out everything from the big           picture down to the nitty-gritty details of each packet.
  - Finding problems: Wireshark can help spot where things are going wrong in the network, like           security breaches or connection issues.
