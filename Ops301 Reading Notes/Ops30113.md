1) What exactly is “Active Directory” and are the key services it provides?
  -  a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks that manages and authenticates user and computer accounts, facilitating authorization and security.
2) What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory?
  - Domain: A security boundary that manages a set of objects (users, devices) under a common directory database.
  - Forest: The highest level of organization in AD, consisting of one or more domains that share a common schema but keep separate databases.
  - Tree: A collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.
3) How can objects (e.g. users, devices) within a domain be grouped?
  - Objects can be grouped into organizational units (OUs) for easier management and application of policies.
4) Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.
  - Active Directory simplifies user and device management, enhances security, and makes access to resources and services seamless across a network.
