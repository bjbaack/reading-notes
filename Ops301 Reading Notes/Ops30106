1) What is the main purpose for implementing NAT on a network?
  - NAT's main purpose is to let multiple devices go online with just one public IP, helping save IP addresses and boosting security a bit.
2) At what layer of the OSI model does NAT happen?
  - NAT operates at the Network layer, which is Layer 3 of the OSI model.
3) What happens to packets when NAT runs out of addresses in the pool of available IPs?
  - If NAT runs out of IP addresses, new devices can't connect to the internet until some addresses are freed up.
4) What disadvantage does using NAT pose for routers?
  - A downside of NAT for routers is it increases their workload, which can slow down the network and make setting up direct connections tricky for certain applications
