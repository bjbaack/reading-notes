1) How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public
  - Create public subnets and attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC.
  - Configure route tables to direct internet-bound traffic from these subnets to the Internet Gateway.
  - Assign Elastic IP addresses to resources that require a fixed public IP.
  - Use Security Groups and Network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.
2) What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part?
  - Public: Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) for hosting websites, Load balancers to distribute incoming internet traffic to different servers, and Public DNS services to resolve domain names for internet-facing services.
  - Private: Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) that store sensitive or operational data, application servers that run business logic behind the scenes, internal services and microservices that are not exposed to the internet but communicate within the VPC.
3) What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?
  - Pros would be Ehhanced security, Customizeable network configuration, and isolation. While cons would be coplexity, cost , and performance considerations.
