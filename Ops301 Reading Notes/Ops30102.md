1)  What is a port? Describe it with an analogy that would help a family member understand.
  - A port is like a door or mailbox on a computer where information comes in or goes out. Just as a house has a specific address, a computer has an IP address, and the doors (ports) are the various entry points for different types of information, like mail for different family members.
2) What does a port scanner send to a port to check the current status?
  - A port scanner sends a network request or packet to connect to a specific TCP or UDP port on a computer to check its current status.
3)  When a port scanner sends a request to connect, what are the three possible responses? Describe them.
  - Open, Accepted: The computer responds positively, indicating it's ready to receive further information, like someone answering the door and inviting you in.
Closed, Not Listening: The computer responds but indicates the port is not available for use, similar to someone answering the door but telling you they're not taking visitors.
Filtered, Dropped, Blocked: The computer does not respond at all, akin to no one answering the door, suggesting either no one is home or they're choosing not to respond.
4) What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
  - TCP is like sending a tracked package, ensuring it arrives in order and is checked for. UDP is more like sending a letter quickly without tracking, perfect for when speed trumps detail, like streaming or gaming.

5) List and describe the ports used for the following:
Telnet: port 23. Used for unsecured remote logins, sending data in plain text.
SSH: port 22. Secure remote logins and file transfers, encrypting data.
DNS: port 53. Translates domain names to IP addresses.
SMTP: port 25. sends emails
HTTP: port 80. tramsimts webpages
HTTPS; port 443. secures web browsing and encrytpts data
RDP: port 3389 connects to remote computers. created by microsoft.
