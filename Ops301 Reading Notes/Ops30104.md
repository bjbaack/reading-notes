### 


1) Which network mode in VirtualBox can be used to emulate unplugging the Ethernet cable from the network?
  - Using the "Not Attached" mode
2) Which network mode would be best if you wanted to run a server on a VM that could be fully accessible from your physical local area network?
  - Bridged Adapter. This makes your VM appear as just another machine on your network, easy for others to reach.
3) What are the three options of promiscuous mode and what does each do?
  - Deny: The VM ignores all traffic that's not meant for it. Think of it as being in its own little world.
  - Allow VMs: The VM can listen in on traffic intended for other VMs that are running on the same host. Kinda like eavesdropping on siblings.
  - Allow All: This lets the VM listen to all traffic on the network, even beyond the host. It's the ultimate eavesdropper.
4) What is Port Forwarding?
  - It's like mail forwarding for internet traffic. You tell your router to send certain internet requests from the outside world straight to your VM, based on the port number. Perfect for running servers or services inside a VM that you want to access from the internet.
