The information in this article is important because we are currently going through the hardware of the computer and it goes into how a hardware hack can happen before you even start up your computer vs downloading a software hack. 

1) A hardware hack, unlike a software hack, involves physical alterations to the device's components, making it more sophisticated and harder to detect. 

2) Spies can alter computer hardware either by intercepting and manipulating devices during manufacturing or by introducing compromised components into the supply chain. 

3) The hack detailed in the article involved tiny, malicious chips inserted into servers, which created a backdoor for unauthorized access. 

4) Investigators traced these chips back to their source by analyzing the altered hardware and following the supply chain back to the manufacturers involved.a
